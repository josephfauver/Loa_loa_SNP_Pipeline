#This document describes the computational steps taken in order to produce the data used for our Loa loa whole genome analysis.
#The purpose of this project is to determine if Loa loa sequenced from the eastern DRC is similar to the two already published Loa loa
#genomes, as well as potentially identify SNPs in gene regions associated with circadian rythm as these worms displayed atypical 
#periodicity.
