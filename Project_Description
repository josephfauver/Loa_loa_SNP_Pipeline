# This document describes the computational steps taken in order to produce the data used for our Loa loa whole genome analysis.
# The purpose of this project is to determine if Loa loa sequenced from the eastern DRC is similar to the two already published Loa loa
# genomes, as well as potentially identify SNPs in gene regions associated with circadian rythm as these worms displayed atypical 
# periodicity. 
#
#
# The main goals of this string of scripts is to
#
# 1)Remove adaptors and low quality reads using Trimmomatic
# 
# 2)Align reads to both reference genomes using BWA mem
#   
#   a) PacBio + Illumina (PRJNA246086)
#   b) 454 Seq (PRJNA60051)
#
# 3)Remove read duplicates using Piccard tools
#
# 4)Call and filter variants according the GATK Best Practices
#
# 5)Annotate SNPs using snpEff
